# NLP Fundamentals Class
Some code that I used to implement the basic/classic NLP operations during my undergraduate NLP basics class. 

Some of its contents are as follows:
- Calculate edit distance of words and using it to find the similar words to a specific word and have basic spell checking and correction
- Tokenize the code and calculate its NFA, DFA, and NPDA 
- Use a Hidden Markov model to analyze the text e.g. check its tag, calculate Transition Probability, and used Viterbi algorithm (an algorith used to find the most likely sequence of hidden states and is used to find sequence of hidden markov model) to create tags for new unseen sentences
